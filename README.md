# Boba.Settings

Boba.Settings is a comprehensive C# library meticulously crafted to streamline the management of application and business settings within projects. Offering a suite of robust functionalities, it empowers developers to efficiently organize and access crucial configurations, thereby enhancing development workflows and ensuring seamless integration of settings across various facets of the application.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Boba.Settings is conveniently available on NuGet. Simply install the provider package corresponding to your target database.

```c#
dotnet add package Boba.Settings.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

Utilize the `--version` option to specify a preview version for installation if needed.

### Basic Usage
Harnessing the power of Boba.Settings is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

#### Registration: 
Begin by registering Boba.Settings in your `program.cs`. Presently, we support SqlServer, necessitating the provision of a connection string. Alternative data store providers are also available.
```c#
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("ConnectionString");
builder.Services.AddBobaSettings().UseSqlServer(connectionString); 
```
#### Configuration:
Define your settings class, inheriting from `ISettings`. Here, you can optionally assign default values to be retrieved in the absence of stored data.

```c#
public class TestSettings : ISettings
{
    public bool Enabled { get; set; } = true;
    public int DefaultLangId { get; set; } = default!;
    public string DefaultColor { get; set; } = "Red";
}
```

#### Utilization: 
Inject the setting service into your application and access the values effortlessly.
```c#
private readonly TestSettings _testSettings;
	
public YourConstructor(TestSettings testSettings)
{
    _testSettings = testSettings;
}

Console.WriteLine(_testSettings.DefaultLangId);

```
Additionally, settings can be loaded manually.

```c#
private readonly ISettingService _settingService;
	
public YourConstructor(ISettingService settingService)
{
    _settingService = settingService;
}

var testSettings = await _settingService.LoadSettingAsync<TestSettings>();

Console.WriteLine(testSettings.DefaultLangId);
```

#### Management:
The ISettingService interface offers a plethora of APIs for seamless management of settings. For instance, to insert settings:
```c#
private readonly ISettingService _settingService;
	
public YourConstructor(ISettingService settingService)
{
    _settingService = settingService;
}

await _settingService.SaveSettingAsync(new TestSettings { DefaultLangId = 1, Enabled = false });
```
